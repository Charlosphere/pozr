              Under no circumstances shall POZR be liable for any direct,
              indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including,
              but not limited to, loss of data or profit, arising out of the

              POZR or an authorized representative has been advised of the
              possibility of such damages.

            <h3>Application Usage And How It Applies</h3>
            <p>
              By using any of the Service, or submitting or collecting any
              Personal Information via the Service, you consent to the
              collection, transfer, storage disclosure, and use of your Personal
              Information in the manner set out in the Privacy Policy. If you do
              not consent to the use of your Personal Information in these ways,
              please stop using the Service.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Terms And Conditions</h3>
            <p>
              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
              apply to you &ndash; you should make sure therefore that you read
              them carefully before using the app. You&rsquo;re not allowed to
              copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in
              any way. You&rsquo;re not allowed to attempt to extract the source
              code of the app, and you also shouldn&rsquo;t try to translate the
              app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app
              itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
              other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
              Charles Baillargeon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Charles Baillargeon is committed to ensuring that the app is as
              useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
              right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
              any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app
              or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
              you&rsquo;re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The POZR app stores and processes personal data that you have
              provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It&rsquo;s your
              responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
              therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
              which is the process of removing software restrictions and
              limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
              device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
              malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone&rsquo;s
              security features and it could mean that the POZR app won&rsquo;t
              work properly or at all.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
                The app does use third party services that declare their own
                Terms and Conditions.

            <p>
              You should be aware that there are certain things that Charles
              Baillargeon will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
              the app will require the app to have an active internet
              connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
              mobile network provider, but Charles Baillargeon cannot take
              responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
              you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t have any
              of your data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <p>
              If you&rsquo;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
              should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile
              network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged
              by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of
              the connection while accessing the app, or other third party
              charges. In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility
              for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use
              the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
              without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer
              for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the app, please be
              aware that we assume that you have received permission from the
              bill payer for using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the same lines, Charles Baillargeon cannot always take
              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
              sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of
              battery and you can&rsquo;t turn it on to avail the Service,
              Charles Baillargeon cannot accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              With respect to Charles Baillargeon&rsquo;s responsibility for
              your use of the app, when you&rsquo;re using the app, it&rsquo;s
              important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure
              that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third
              parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
              available to you. Charles Baillargeon accepts no liability for any
              loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
              wholly on this functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
              available on Android &amp; iOS &ndash; the requirements for both
              systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the app to) may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Charles
              Baillargeon does not promise that it will always update the app so
              that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS
              version that you have installed on your device. However, you
              promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
              to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
              terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
              termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
              termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
              terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
              delete it from your device.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Applicable Law And Jurisdiction</strong></h4>
            <p>
              The Mobile Application can be accessed from all countries around
              the world where the local technology permits. As each of these
              places have differing laws, by accessing the Mobile Application
              both you and we agree that the laws of Canada, without regard to
              the conflicts of laws principles thereof, will apply to all
              matters relating to the use of the Mobile Application. You accept
              and agree that both you and we shall submit to the exclusive
              jurisdiction of the courts of Canada in respect of any dispute
              arising out of and/or in connection with these Terms and
              Conditions of Use.
