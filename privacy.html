            <p>
              I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case
              of an error in the app I collect data and information (through
              third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
              may include information such as your device Internet Protocol
              (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, device name, operating system version,
              the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time
              and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
              used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
              browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
              device&apos;s internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Service does not use these &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; explicitly.
              However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use
              &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information and improve their
              services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these
              cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If
              you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
              portions of this Service.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>
              I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
              following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>To facilitate our Service;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To provide the Service on our behalf;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To perform Service-related services; or</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
              have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform
              the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
              obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other
              purpose.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>
              I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus
              we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting
              it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet,
              or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I
              cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
            <p>
              This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
              third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that
              these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
              advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
              no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
              privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
              services.

            <p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>
              These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
              knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
              children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13
              has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete
              this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
              aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
              please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
